## Global, Business, Journalism 

Global, Busiess, Journalism stands out the Maria's identity. After undergraduates, she started her work as a journalist. After few years, she rose to managing Editor Business and achieved multiple successes as well. 

### Global 

During President Xi Jinping’s visit to Fiji in November 2014, he had announced the establishment of a Chinese Culture Center in the country, which stands tall now seven years later.

Chinese Ambassador to Fiji, Qian Bo, said the China Cultural Center in Fiji had done much to strengthen China-Fiji relations of which I am a testament of. In 2017, I learned basic Mandarin at the China Cultural Centre in Suva.

I was invited later the same year to attend the Cultural Tour in China as one of the two representatives selected from our Chinese Class at the China Cultural Centre.
It was an educational tour. It made me realise that I should learn the Chinese language and culture more. And also learn more on China’s economy.

### Business

In my section we cover business from the stock market, commodity prices, aviation, agriculture, tourism, and overall locally and international news that impact Fiji, Fijians and the economy.

I am currently, responsible for overall in charge of developing and running the most extensive business and finance reporting in the Pacific Islands. The Fiji Sun is the biggest daily newspaper in the Pacific Islands, in a region where print editions of newspapers are still widely read. 

My team produces a minimum of four pages daily in our print edition, a 16-page Saturday Business Liftout and daily digital reportage on our various platforms.
We carry Xinhua for international news and also have links with China Daily. 

### Journalism 

 In mid 2014, I had a stint as Acting Editor North making an impact there.This would be the beginning of my leadership role. Upon return to the Suva headquarters saw me taking charge of the engine room – the subeditor’s desk/department.

I also looked after a special project in 2017 where the Fiji Sun produced the biggest weekend newspaper boasting up to more than 200 pages. I then moved to head the business department where she is managing – seven-days-a-week (even on her days off) a dedicated team of four.
