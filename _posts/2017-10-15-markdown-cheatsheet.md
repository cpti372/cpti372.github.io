title: Five things that can make you better off using internet vs Five things you can’t do without the internet 
summary: Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formating words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

<text align="center"><b>Coline usually wakes up at 7:30 a.m. and checks her WeChat message. Then, after she delivers her breakfast through the delivery application, she watches her favorite YouTube channels. It's her daily morning routine. 
 
When she goes to school, she usually uses a bike-sharing application. Because of COVID-19, she must scan the QR code using a cellular phone whenever entering the school. In this semester, she took 15 credits, but some courses shifted to online. She accesses the zoom application via her laptop. 
 
 8:00 p.m., all her schedule ends! She posts some photos on her SNS and chats with her friends. 11:00 p.m., listening to podcast, she goes to bed.

<p>There's a whole lot of stuff available online, just like Coline's daily life. From taking a class to delivering her dish, we spend most of our time on the Internet. Do you imagine your life without the Internet? As for me, I cannot. Impossible. No Internet, No life. Here are the five things that can make you better off using the Internet.</p>

<h2>1.	Self – improvement</h2>
<p>MOOC, Coursera, Udemy. The high quality of Internet education website always welcomes you. Without going there, you can enroll high regarded university course at your home. It's time for envisioning your dream, just staying at home.</p>

<h2>2.	File and Data transfer</h2>
<p>My life has changed after using Google Drive. Before then, collecting USBs was one of my hobbies, but I always forgot to put them on my desk. Google Drive serves unlimited storage for users and enables us to share with our friends. So, we don't need to take so much time to send photos to friends. Just click the share button, write down her e-mail. It's all</p>

<h2>3.	Networking</h2>
<p>If you want to go abroad or if you're supposed to start your new career at a new place? Internet will help you realize your goal. Helpful tips and interviews expect you to meet on the webpage. LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Like-minded, valuable people are always waiting for you. Be friends with them, expand your network</p>

<h2>4.	Entertainment</h2>
<p>Did you already see 'Squid Game' or 'Parasite'? If not, you should sign up for Netflix and start your subscription. The Internet provides you with various genres of content. Not only media content but also the game can relieve your stress. All the entertainment on the website brings humor and vitality to your life. </p>

<h2>5.	E-commerce</h2>
<p>I go to Spain once a year to buy Zara clothes. But due to COVID-19, I have not been there for more than two years. But no worries. We have the Internet to connect with the store. Just visit the website and click. We can buy anything on the Internet</p>
<br>
<p>Could you realize how the Internet plays a significant part in life? I think the Internet has already become a necessity like water. From now on, assuming the situation, live without the Internet. There are also five things we cannot do without the Internet.</p>

<h2>1.	Take a lesson</h2>
<p>Since 2020, 98% of universities have moved classes online. eLearning becomes an obligation, not a selection, nowadays. If there were no internet, we might meet together and even enter this school.</p>

<h2>2.	Mobile payment</h2>
<p>These days, I feel bringing a wallet is sometimes useless. Apple pay, WeChat Pay, Alipay lessen my burden to memorize if I got my purse or not. No need to go bank to withdraw cash; just show your screen and scan the code. It's all. But there's one thing to remember. You should turn on your cellular when using it. Therefore, it means no data, cannot buy anything.</p>

<h2>3.	Communication</h2>
<p>How often do you send text messages? Maybe 50 times per minute or more than I guess. We send important notices, make business appointments, and say hello to our grandparents via the Internet. If we are in a place without Internet access, it loses our connection to the world. In case, we might use pigeons to carry messages like the Romans.</p>

<h2>4.	Travel</h2>
<p>Traveling the world will be problematic. How can we book the hotel, tickets and search for fancy places to go? Not only going abroad but also domestic flights can't make it. Without Internet equals no GPS. No one can find the ways; they lose their ways at least 500 meters.</p>

<h2>5.	News </h2>
<p>How much information do we spend a day? According to research, we process as much as 74GB of data a day. Among them, more than fifty percent take the news. News offers opportunities to do creative thinking and enhance our knowledge of other countries.</p>
