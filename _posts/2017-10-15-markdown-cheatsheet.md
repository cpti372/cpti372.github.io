title: Five things that can make you better off using internet vs Five things you canâ€™t do without the internet 
summary: Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formating words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

<text align="center"><b>Coline usually wakes up at 7:30 a.m. and checks her WeChat message. Then, after she delivers her breakfast through the delivery application, she watches her favorite YouTube channels. It's her daily morning routine. 
 
 When she goes to school, she usually uses a bike-sharing application. Because of COVID-19, she must scan the QR code using a cellular phone whenever entering the school. In this semester, she took 15 credits, but some courses shifted to online. She accesses the zoom application via her laptop. 
 
 8:00 p.m., all her schedule ends! She posts some photos on her SNS and chats with her friends. 11:00 p.m., listening to podcast, she goes to bed.
