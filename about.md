Yeonsu Kim graduated from Hanyang University, majoring in Computer Science. She worked as a technical writer for an IT company, Kakao, in Korea. She has published technology articles about artificial Intelligence and prepared AI speaker manuals for engineers and consumers, supporting those who face difficulties communicating complex and technical information. Formulating the company’s style guide was another work, helping people grasping the jargon. 
Experiences in her academic and professional journey have primarily focused on communication, technology, and social issues, which drives her to explore the importance of communication in every field.

Study-abroad experiences in Shanghai and Amsterdam in 2019 and 2020 bolstered her interest in covering social and technical issues. As a freelance reporter, she has mainly covered the smart city and digital divide. Selected to serve on the committee for research in Amsterdam, she taught the importance of using media to draw people closer together around technology when addressing social impact issues. In addition, cooperation with Amsterdam Economic Board enabled her to comprehend how different Korea and Europe’s city planning models are. 

Conducting research internships at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, she imparted undeveloped and dilapidated areas with no technology and no signal of social support system. She wrote a paper concerning its solution by conveying the discrepancy between the developed and underprivileged regions. Both experiences attracted her to foster knowledge about communication and could form a foundation to realize her dream to be a journalist who covers topics related to technology and social issues.
