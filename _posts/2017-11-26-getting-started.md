# Bula!

<h1 style="text-align:center"><b>Bula</b> is the most common word in the Fijian language. It is the same as “Hello” in English.</h1>

Today, I am going to introduce one of my colleagues from Fiji islands. Maria, the 2021 cohort of GBJ, is from Fiji Islands. She is the business editor working at [Fiji Sun](https://fijisun.com.fj/) based in Suva, Fiji.

Through this interview, I can get much closer to her, and I hope the discussion below will be perfect for understanding who she is.

## Global, Business, Journalism 

<b>Global, Business, Journalism</b> stands out Maria’s identity. After her undergraduates, she started her work as a journalist. Few years later, she promoted to manage the editor Business and achieved multiple successes as well. 

### Global 

[The Fiji Sun](https://fijisun.com.fj/) is the biggest daily newspaper in the Pacific Islands, where print editions of newspapers are still widely read. Her team produces a minimum of four pages daily in our print edition, a 16-page Saturday Business Liftout, and daily digital reportage on various platforms. In addition, they carry Xinhua news agency for international news and have connections with China Daily.

### Business

As a business journalist, she covers business news including the stock market, commodity prices, aviation, agriculture, tourism, and overall local and international news impacting Fiji. She is currently responsible for running the most extensive business and finance reporting in the Pacific Islands. 

### Journalism 

In mid-2014, she had a stint as Acting Editor North making an impact where it would be the beginning of her leadership role. Upon return to the Suva, headquarters saw her taking charge of the engine room – the subeditor’s desk/department. She also conducted a particular project in 2017 where the Fiji Sun produced the biggest weekend newspaper boasting up to more than 200 pages. Then she moved to head the business department, where she manages a dedicated team of four seven days a week (even on her days off).

## Tsinghua, new start 

### Why China

During President Xi Jinping’s visit to Fiji in November 2014, he had announced the establishment of a Chinese Culture Center in the country, which stands tall now seven years later. Chinese Ambassador of Fiji, Qian Bo, said the China Cultural Center in Fiji had done much to strengthen China-Fiji relations, which became a testament to her. In 2017, she learned basic Mandarin at the China Cultural Centre in Suva.

She participated in the culture education Tour in China as one of the two representatives from the China Cultural Center. After visiting, she thought that learning Chinese language and paying attention to China’s economy and culture is needed.

### Why Tsinghua 

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/image/xinjiatihuanjjide02.jpg"><img src="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/image/xinjiatihuanjjide02.jpg" type="image"></a></p>

Her main reason for obtaining a master’s degree in Global Business Journalism is its <b>unique teaching technique with a combination of journalism and business with global students.</b>

### Excellence 

When asked to define GBJ as one word, without hesitation, she said <b>“excellence.” </b> Obtaining a Master of Arts in Global Journalism will enable her long-term goals to come true, such as building the business team and widening the business coverage in Fiji and the Pacific region. Furthermore, she would also like to continue to train journalists to broaden their knowledge and inform the public, bringing about the benefit of both Fiji and the Pacific Islands.
